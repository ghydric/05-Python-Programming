2. ShiftSupervisor Class
    In a particular factory, a shift supervisor is a salaried employee who supervises a shift. In
    addition to a salary, the shift supervisor earns a yearly bonus when his or her shift meets
    production goals. Write a ShiftSupervisor class that is a subclass of the Employee class
    you created in Programming Exercise 1. The ShiftSupervisor class should keep a data
    attribute for the annual salary and a data attribute for the annual production bonus that a
    shift supervisor has earned. Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses a
    ShiftSupervisor object.
